<h1>PrairieDraw.js Developer Manual</h1>

<p>Other sources of information are the <a href="">Reference
Manual</a>, the <a href="userManual.html">User Manual</a>, and
the <a href="http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/docs.html">Sylvester
Docs</a> for vectors and matrices.

<h2>Coding style</h2>

<p>We use standard
JavaScript <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototypal
inheritance</a> for the objects.

<p>Instance variables and member functions starting with an underscore
are understood to be private and for internal use only. Apart from
this, we
follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_%28programming%29#Java">Java
naming conventions</a>.

<p>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc">JSDoc</a> for
inline documentation
(particularly <a href="https://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/">jsdoc-toolkit</a>).

<h2><tt>draw()</tt> and <tt>redraw()</tt></h2>

<p>The user-supplied anonymous function in the constructor call is
bound to the member function <tt>draw()</tt>. This should not
generally be called explicitly, however. Instead, <tt>redraw()</tt>
should be called, which is overridden by the <tt>PrairieDrawAnim</tt>
child.

<h2>Coordinate systems</h2>

<p>There are two coordinate systems used: Dw is "drawing coordinates"
and is used for positions and vectors, while Px is "pixel coordinates"
and is used for line widths, arrow sizes, etc. The transformation from
Dw to Px is stored in the <tt>_trans</tt> instance variable. This is
an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation">affine
transformation matrix</a>
(using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneous
coordinates</a>). The transformation matrix is pushed/popped from a
transformation stack by <tt>save()</tt>/<tt>restore()</tt>.

<p>To convert from Dw to Px coordinates we use <tt>pos2Px</tt> (for
positions) and <tt>vec2Px</tt> (for vectors). The vector
transformation only uses the linear part of the affine
transformation. The inverse transforms are <tt>pos2Dw</tt>
and <tt>vec2Dw</tt>.

<p>All PrairieDraw functions should leave the 2D Canvas coordinate
system unmodified, so we should do a <tt>_ctx.save()</tt>
and <tt>_ctx.restore()</tt> around any canvas coordinate
transformations.

<p>In the code, variables are suffixed with either <tt>Dw</tt>
or <tt>Px</tt> to indicate which coordinate system they are in.

<h2>Properties, colors, and options</h2>

<p>Drawing properties are stored in the <tt>_props</tt> instance
variable object and pushed/popped from a stack
by <tt>save()</tt>/<tt>restore()</tt>. Properties include colors to
indicate standard types of objects. Object drawing functions
(like <tt>rod()</tt>, <tt>pivot()</tt>, etc.) should set all
appropriate style and color properties from <tt>_props</tt> data and
should clear them before exit.

<p>Options stored in the <tt>_options</tt> instance variable object
are for user-created options. These are <em>not</em> push/popped
by <tt>save()</tt>/<tt>restore()</tt>, as they need to persist across
multiple <tt>draw()</tt> invocations.

<p>Calling <tt>setOption()</tt> or <tt>setProp()</tt> triggers
a <tt>redraw()</tt>.

<h2>Animation</h2>

<p>There are three times used for animation by
the <tt>PrairieDrawAnim</tt> child class: wall-time in milliseconds,
animation time in milliseconds, and animation time in seconds.

<p>Animation is implemented using <tt>requestAnimationFrame()</tt>, which calls
<tt>_callback()</tt> with the wall-time in milliseconds. We offset by
the <tt>_timeOffset</tt> instance variable to obtain the current
animation time in milliseconds. This allows for the animation to be
paused and restarted without skipping. The <tt>_startFrame</tt>
instance variable set to <tt>true</tt> when animation begins, which
triggers the recalculation of <tt>_timeOffset</tt>.

<p>The <tt>_drawTime</tt> instance variable stores the animation time
in milliseconds of the last <tt>draw()</tt> call, for use
by <tt>redraw()</tt> when the animation is not running.

<p>The user-supplied <tt>draw(t)</tt> function is called with
time <tt>t</tt> being the animation time in seconds.
